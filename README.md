The goal of this project is to understand if the number of participate affects Generalization of the model's. The dataset comes from the [CNeuroMod](https://www.cneuromod.ca/) dataset, and consists of multimodal movie stimuli and corresponding whole-brain time series fMRI responses of four subjects. A subset of CNeuroMod's data which includes almost 80 hours of multimodal movie stimuli and corresponding fMRI responses. The stimuli consist of movie visual frames, audio samples, and time-stamped language transcripts. The neural data consist of whole-brain fMRI responses for four CNeuroMod subjects (sub-01, sub-02, sub-03 and sub-05), normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) spatial template ([Brett et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn756)), and processed as time series whose signal is assigned to 1,000 functionally defined brain parcels ([Schaefer et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx179)).
For this experiement sub-05 was removed from the training and is treated as the test set.
